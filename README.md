Until now :
-created the mvc model for product
-checking them with postman tool 

@RequestMapping - does the same  acts as a get and post doesn't have specificity so we from now on we use 
@GetMapping - to retrieve someting from server 
@PostMapping - to send data from the client 

@PathVariable-Get the data from the client and checks from the server 
@RequestBody-Takes the data from tbe client and places them in the server 

-We have created a methods for retriveing the data from the server and the adding them to the server for now and that is all we need for now usinf get and post methods.
